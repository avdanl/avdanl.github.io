From the looks of it, certain brands dominate in terms of quantity sold and total spending, indicating their popularity.\nNow, let‚Äôs calculate the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase. For this, we‚Äôll consider each row in the dataset as a separate purchase and compute the averages accordingly.\n\n# Calculate average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase\naverage_purchase = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({\n    'quantity': 'mean', \n    'dollar_spent': 'mean'\n}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by average quantity and average spending\naverage_purchase_sorted_quantity = average_purchase.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)\naverage_purchase_sorted_spent = average_purchase.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting average quantity for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Quantity')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# Plotting average spending for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Spending on Beer by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations above depict the average quantity of beer purchased per brand and the average spending per brand. This shows which brands tend to be bought in larger quantities on average and which brands tend to have higher spending per purchase, which could be indicative of their price point or the purchase of premium products.\nNext, we‚Äôll look at the total spending across different markets to see if there are any notable differences in spending habits geographically. To do this, we‚Äôll sum up the spending in each market and visualize it.\n\n# Calculate total spending in each market\nmarket_spending_summary = beer_data.groupby('market').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nmarket_spending_summary_sorted = market_spending_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending in each market\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='market', data=market_spending_summary_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Market')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Market')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the total spending on beer by market, showcasing the differences in spending habits across various regions.

    "text": "Promotional Impact\nWe‚Äôll assess the impact of promotions on the quantity of beer purchased. For this analysis, we can calculate the average quantity purchased with and without promotions and visualize the difference. We‚Äôll do this for each brand to see which brands are most affected by promotions.\nLet‚Äôs begin this analysis by looking at the average quantity purchased with and without promotions for each brand.\n\n# Calculate average quantity purchased with and without promotions for each brand\npromo_impact = beer_data.groupby(['brand', 'promo']).agg({'quantity':'mean'}).reset_index()\n\n# Pivot the data to have promo and non-promo side by side for each brand\npromo_impact_pivot = promo_impact.pivot(index='brand', columns='promo', values='quantity').reset_index()\npromo_impact_pivot.columns = ['brand', 'non_promo', 'promo']\n\n# Calculate the difference in average quantity purchased between promo and non-promo\npromo_impact_pivot['promo_impact'] = promo_impact_pivot['promo'] - promo_impact_pivot['non_promo']\n\n# Sort by the impact of promo\npromo_impact_pivot_sorted = promo_impact_pivot.sort_values('promo_impact', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting the difference in average quantity purchased between promo and non-promo for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.barplot(x='promo_impact', y='brand', data=promo_impact_pivot_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Impact of Promotions on Average Quantity Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Difference in Average Quantity Purchased (Promo - Non-Promo)')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the impact of promotions on the average quantity of beer purchased by brand. A positive value indicates that, on average, more beer is purchased when there is a promotion compared to when there isn‚Äôt. Some brands appear to be significantly more influenced by promotions, with customers buying more when the products are on sale or promotion.\nThis comprehensive analysis has provided insights into purchase patterns, demographic preferences, price sensitivity, and the impact of promotions on beer purchases."
