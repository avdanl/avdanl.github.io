# Introduction

About this project :clap:

The Tokyo 2021 Olympics marked a significant global event, showcasing the pinnacle of athletic prowess and international sportsmanship. As part of a comprehensive analysis, this project delves into the performance of the top teams during the Tokyo Olympics, with a focus on visualizing their achievements using the R programming language.

Through the lens of data visualization, this project aims to provide a compelling and insightful representation of the medal counts garnered by the leading nations. The dataset captures essential details such as the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals, offering a nuanced perspective on each team's overall success.

Utilizing the versatile capabilities of R, a powerful statistical computing language, we employ various visualization techniques to present a comprehensive overview of the top-performing teams. From bar graphs to line charts, these visualizations are designed to convey not only the sheer quantity of medals but also the distribution of success across different medal categories.


# Variable Description

1. Rank: Where each country stands as opposed to other countries
2. Team/NOC: Each country that has participated
3. gold_medal: 1st place award for a country
4. silver_medal: 2nd place award for a country
5. bronze_medal: 3rd place award for a country
6. total: How many awards for each participant/country
7. continent: which continent each country belongs to

## Top Ten Tokyo Olympics Teams
The Following bargraph shows the different teams in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, and how 
many different medals they each have. The data could be used to show the odds of the next Olympic winner.


```{r}
# 
if (!requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
library(ggplot2)

#
medal_data <- data.frame(
  Rank = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10),
  Team = c("United States of America", "People's Republic of China", "Japan", "Great Britain", "ROC", "Australia", "Netherlands", "France", "Germany", "Italy"),
  Gold = c(39, 38, 27, 22, 20, 17, 10, 10, 10, 10),
  Silver = c(41, 32, 14, 21, 28, 7, 12, 12, 11, 10),
  Bronze = c(33, 18, 17, 22, 23, 22, 14, 11, 16, 20),
  Total_Medals = c(113, 88, 58, 65, 71, 46, 36, 33, 37, 40),
  Team_Code = c("USA", "CHN", "JPN", "GBR", "ROC", "AUS", "NED", "FRA", "GER", "ITA"),
  Region = c("North America", "Asia", "Asia", "Europe", "Europe/Asia", "Australia", "Europe", "Europe", "Europe", "Europe")
)

# 
ggplot(medal_data, aes(x = reorder(Team, Total_Medals), y = Total_Medals, fill = Region)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Top Ten Teams in Tokyo 2021 Olympics",
       x = "Team",
       y = "Total Medals",
       fill = "Region") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))



```

# Analysis

From the above bar graph, we can see that the United States of America has by far won the most medals out of all countries, followed by China, ROC, Great Britain, Japan, Australia, Italy, Germany, Netherlands and France. All have won over 30 medals and are the top ten countries in the Olympics.



## Key Insights

The United States dominated the medal count with the highest total, achieving a remarkable balance across gold, silver, and bronze categories.

China and Japan secured the second and third positions, respectively, with significant total medal counts.

The European nations of Great Britain, ROC, Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy collectively performed well, occupying positions four through ten in the ranking.

Australia represented Oceania and performed well, landing in the sixth position.

The data provides a clear visual representation of the top-performing teams in the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, offering insights into the distribution of medals among nations.
